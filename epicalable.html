        <h4 style="color:#ff6600;">Introduction to our organisation</h2>
            <p class="w3-justify">
                Epicalable is a brand founded and created on 2019 primarily as a youtube gaming channel. Soon the small
                scale
                organisation moved into the coding world and established a base in github to post free, open-source
                repositories
                for the world to see. Our aim is to bring an end to many problems both in the computer industry and the
                real
                world through innovating and solving problems. We have worked on few projects so far with a constant
                hope
                that we can help the world in a small positive way. While we still have some ongoing and some ambitious
                projects coming up we will like to ask you to support our organisation by simply visiting our github
                projects and contribute to them to help support us and improve our projects for others.
            </p>

        <h4 style="color:#ff6600;">What we do in Epicalable?</h2>
            <p>
                Like we said Epicalable is an organisation that hopes to impact the world in a postive way weather
                big or small with
                the help of coding and free projects for everyone in our society to use. Epicalable may have a few
                projects but
                those have helped people from different walks in life to help their lives feel a bit easier. Our
                goal to innovate and
                advance technology we know today might be hard but everyday new achievments and milestones are being
                made, so why not be a part of it here at Epicalable.
