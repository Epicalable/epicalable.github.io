        <h1 style="color: #0c9;"> Welcome to Epicalable Website</h2> 

            <p>
                Epicalable is a brand founded and created on 2019 primarily as a youtube gaming channel. Soon the small scale
                organisation moved into the coding world and established a base in github to post free, open-source repositories
                for the world to see. It's aim is to bring an end to many problems both in the computer world and the real world.
                We have worked on few projects so far with a constant hope that we can help the world in a small positive way.
                While we still have some ongoing and some ambitious projects coming up we will like to ask you to support our
                organisation by simply visiting our github projects and contribute to them to help us improve upon them.
            </p>
