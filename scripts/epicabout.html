            <h4 style="color:#000000;">About our organisation</h4>
                <p class="epic-justify">
                    Epicalable is a brand founded and created on 2019 primarily as a youtube gaming channel. Soon the small scale
                    startup moved into the coding world and established a base in github to post free, open-source repositories
                    for the world to see. Our aim is to bring an end to many problems both in the computer industry and the real
                    world through open-source projects by innovating and solving problems. We have worked on a very few small-scaled projects so far with a constant hope
                    that we can help the world in a small positive way. While we still have some ongoing and some ambitious
                    projects coming up we will like to ask you to support our startup by simply visiting our github
                    projects and contributing to them by starring and reporting a issue to help fix bugs and mistakes and improve our projects for others.
                </p>

            <h4 style="color:#000000;">What we do in Epicalable?</h2>
                <p class="epic-justify">
                    Here at Epicalable we usually make programs coded in python, C++ and also do web design using html and css. 
                    We mostly spend time developing products by creating, testing and deploying our products and then also improve the design and 
                    code optimisation for our projects and also spend time reviewing codes for all our products (including this website) to make 
                    sure it is updated to today's standards and informations available. 
                    We also learn new things as we code with the help of stackoverflow and other helpful websites as references.
                    Epicalable may have a few projects but we hope that it has helped people from different walks of life.
                    To innovate and advance technology we know today well it might be hard but everyday new achievments and milestones in 
                    coding logic, practices and habits are being made, so why not be a part of it here at Epicalable by contributing to our open-source 
                    projects over at github.
                    <br>
                    Note: As of 1st May 2023 all of Epicalable Systems have been upgraded to Windows 11 to keep up with current industrial standards.
